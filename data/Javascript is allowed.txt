Javascript is allowed:
1. as a file with LWC (ROOT or SUB FOLDERS)
2. Another LWC component for import

If javascript is added to another folder in LWC or or directories - the file will not save to the org - even if it is in the local project.

Code will not compile if an imcorrect file is referenced as an import
- but it does not check for export class and function names.

function not exported will be flagged in a save
